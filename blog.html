                                <p>Our hero has won the battle, but wait! The war is far from over. At some point, it starts to dawn on him … Where exactly are you going to take your date-to-be?</p>
                                <p>“Oh, I know!” the kid exclaims. “I’m going to take her out to dinner, and then see a movie. Then I’m going to yawn and stretch and put my arm around her. Yeah, that’ll work!”</p>
                                <p>Let’s back up a second and look at this objectively. This kids plan is to carry a conversation between awkward mouthfuls of chicken parmigiana, and then sit in a pitch black room where talking is frowned upon to watch a movie that may or may not be any good. And then he’ll try and make a move on a person he barely knows.</p>
                                <p>No-one can blame the guy though. School teaches us how to calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle and derive third order equations where x=doughnut and y=rainbows … but learning how to develop intimate connections with other human beings?</p>
                                <h4>NO!</h4>
                                <h4>CALCULATE THE DAMN HYPOTENUSE! AND STOP ASKING QUESTIONS!</h4>
                                <p>So … Our ideas of what a first date should be are complete cactus. Going out for dinner and movies is a terrible first date. Forget about it. You have to get to know someone before you do that. And while we’re on the topic of forgetting things, put that book of Pythagoras Theorem in the bin too. You won’t be needing it. Ever.</p>
                                <p>Thus begins our solution. What makes a great first date? Just like grandma’s apple pie, there is a straightforward recipe you can use every time you’re aiming to leave a lasting impression on a date. Whether you’re a guy or a girl, it doesn’t matter. Remember these points and you’ll be a star.</p>
