                        <p>The problem with dating apps is that once you meet, you have to try and figure out something

                            by tailoring any event you require.</p>
                        <p>That could a first date, an anniversary, or "just because!"</p>

                        <p>There are plenty of sites that help you find things to do - but only if you have the time to
                            sift through ads and 3000+ articles on places that aren't even around anymore!</p>

                        <p>We create custom, personalised recommendations on what you could be doing. That could be for

                        <p>You won't find any sneaky articles here that talk about how great the latest phone or app is.
                            We don't stand for that.</p>
                        <p>You won't get auto-responders that send the same thing out to thousands of people. You'll get

                            awesome movie and a recipe for a night in. No cost to you!</p>
                        <p><b>Member</b> - This is where we get to know each other better, and once we do, we will send
                            you a weekly email that's personalised for you. You'll also be able to reach out to us
                            through the site with any particular requests, and we will work with you to make them
                            happen. We can be besties! <b> Cost - $10 per month, cancel anytime.</b></p>
                        <p><b>Executive</b> - We get it; it's difficult for high-flyers to make the time for their
                            relationship. This option solves that. Want a night away from the kids? No problem, we'll
                            organise a babysitter. Need a week-long holiday? No problem, we can handle that too. Need a
                            candlelit dinner whilst serenaded by the Gypsy Kings? I think we can make it happen. We are
                            on call to assist. <b> Currently full!</b></p>

                        nights. We both work long hours so when we do carve out time to be together, we got bored of the
                        usual Netflix-and-UberEats. Variety is the spice of life, right? VibeDate's ideas helped us
                        heaps, and they're always so prompt when we have questions for them!</p>

                        everything for me so all I really had to do was bring my bf along. It was awesome, and we'll be
